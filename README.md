# Simplifinanc AI-Agent/Integration

Simplifinance AI-powered bot and miniApp


Simplifinance aims to provide users with multiple loan faucets with full control of their liquidity in order to maximize capital efficiency. Our MVP - FlexPool is a customized liquidity pool for short-term crypto loan services focusing on all categories of users. 

## How FlexPool works

Flexpool is designed with emphasis on true decentralization, user control, and healthy loan competition to accommodate lower-class to middle-class users. Through liquidity synergy, users can create a large pool of funds, with little or no interest, rotate it in form or loan among themselves, invest their collaterals via the __Yield__ dashboard, and share the proceeds accordingly. The liquidity generated in a pool is accessible only to the contributors. You can view FlexPool as a form of loan equity where users provide only a part of the aggregate loan (based on the expected number of contributors) to access the total contributed amounts in the form of borrowed funds payable within a short period, usually between 1 to 30 days. FlexPools are owned and controlled by the users not us.


## Project structure

The project is splitted into two main categories:
- __[Action Based - repo](https://github.com/simplifinance/simplifi)__ : Usual way to interact with an application through a call-to-action such as clicking a button to get response (s). Github __[repo](https://github.com/simplifinance/simplifi)__. Interact __[here](https://testnet.simplifinance.xyz)__

- __[AI Assist - repo](https://github.com/bobeu/simplifinance_bot_miniapp)__ : This a text based mode of interacting with the Simplifinance's backend via AI agent. The Agent is able to connect and perform read and write access to the Simplifi's backend on behalf of the user using text prompts. Currently, we are working to improve the quality of the UI for this category. You can find the demo __[here]()__.
